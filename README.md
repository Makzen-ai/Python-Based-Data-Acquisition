Overview
This repository contains a Python-based data acquisition system that collects data from an accelerometer and a thermocouple sensor. It serves as an alternative to LabVIEW, allowing seamless data collection, storage, and analysis. The project also includes functionality for simultaneous data acquisition and SQLite database storage.


Features
*Captures data from an accelerometer and thermocouple sensor.
*SQLite Database Integration: Stores acquired data for later analysis.
*Comparison with LabVIEW Outputs: Validates the Python-based system by comparing results with LabVIEW.
